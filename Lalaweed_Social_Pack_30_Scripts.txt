Lalaweed — 30 Short-Form Video Scripts (TikTok / Reels / Shorts)
30-day posting calendar + captions & hashtags. Focus: education, safety, product showcases, vendor spotlights, same-day delivery stories, promos, and UGC.

GENERAL NOTES:
- Keep each video 15-45s where possible. Use vertical 9:16. Hook in first 1-3s. End with CTA (Follow / Visit site / Link in bio / Use code).
